			"instructions" : "Take your steaks out of the fridge 30 minutes before you want to start grilling, so they can come to room temperature. Prepare the charcoal grill to medium-high heat on one side of your grill, and medium-low heat on the other. You will need just a few briquettes on the cooler side of the grill to maintain the low heat. (If using a gas grill, heat one side of the grill to medium-high heat and the other to low.)When the grill is hot and ready to go, brush the grill grates with some olive oil. Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper. Place the steaks on the hot side of the grill for 3 to 4 minutes, then flip and grill for another 4 minutes. Once the steaks have a nice caramelized crust, move them to the cooler part of the grill, and continue cooking for 6 to 7 minutes for medium rare, or 8 to 9 minutes for medium. Remove the steaks from grill, and tent loosely with foil to keep warm. Let the steaks rest for 5 minutes, so the juices can redistribute throughout the meat. Spread steaks with the roasted shallot and herb butter.NOTE When you're grilling such a thick piece of meat, it's best to cook at a high temperature, to sear the outside nicely, then move to the cooler side of the grill, to give the inside of the steak a moment to catch up. This is especially important if you like your steaks the way Pat does, more on the medium side than medium rare.                                                ROASTED SHALLOT AND HERB BUTTER:                                        GINA: Roasting the shallot gives it a deep, sweet flavor, and the lemon zest lightens the whole thing up. This butter would also be an excellent topping for fish or chicken.Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Place the shallot on a square of foil, drizzle lightly with olive oil, and season with salt and pepper. Fold up the foil into a little packet, and place in the oven for 1 hour. Let cool completely. Pulse the roasted shallot and remaining ingredients in a food processor until combined but still coarse. Scrape the butter onto a piece of plastic wrap, spread it across lengthwise, and roll into a log. Twist the ends to seal. Place in the fridge to firm up for at least 35 minutes before serving.

			"instructions" : "Place red lentils and yellow split peas into a large bowl and cover with water. Let soak for a few minutes and swish to wash the lentils and split peas. Drain well and rinse. Place in a slow cooker and add the 6 cups water. Add the diced tomatoes, onion, garlic, ginger, turmeric, cardamom pods, bay leaf, salt and black pepper.Heat a small skillet over medium heat. Add all of the seeds to the pan. Shake the pan while on the heat, or use a wooden spoon to stir, while toasting the seeds. When they smell fragrant, remove from heat and transfer to the slow cooker. (It will probably bubble up a bit as the hot seed hit the liquid.) Stir well to combine all ingredients. Place lid on slow cooker and let cook on high for 4-5 hours or low for 8-10 hours.Remove lid after cooking time and stir. Taste and if lentils are not soft, cook for another 30-60 minutes, if needed. Add more salt and pepper, if needed.To serve - Ladle the daal over brown rice and top with a squeeze of fresh lemon, cilantro, and more seeds, if desired."
